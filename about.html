        I recently graduated with a degree in Software Engineering, where I gained hands-on experience in designing and developing software solutions. 
        Throughout my studies, I discovered that what excited me most wasn’t just building the technology itself, but crafting the experience around it. 
        I naturally gravitated toward UI/UX design making sure interfaces were intuitive, aesthetically appealing, and easy to navigate.
        <p>Even when UX wasn’t a core requirement for a project, I found myself investing time into the visual design and user flow.
          I often shared prototypes with friends and family to gather feedback, observe how they interacted with the interface, and understand what elements stood out. 
          This process of testing, refining, and designing with users in mind helped me develop a strong foundation in user research, usability thinking, and interface design.</p>
        <p>I’m passionate about creating products that not only function well but also feel delightful and meaningful to use and I’m eager to continue growing as a UI/UX designer,
          bringing thoughtful, user-centered design into every project I work on.</p>
