<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section class="case-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      EmpowHer is a networking platform built specifically for women in the industry —
      especially those in STEM — who often experience underrepresentation and isolation
      in the workforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal was to create a space where early-career professionals and experienced
      mentors could meaningfully connect, exchange knowledge, and grow together.

<!-- PROBLEM -->
<section class="case-section alt-bg">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <div class="two-column">
      <div>
        <h3>Limited Discoverability</h3>
        <p>
          Users struggled to find professionals outside their industry.
          The algorithm limited cross-field exploration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Static Explore Page</h3>
        <p>
          The Explore page felt passive and unengaging,
          reducing opportunities for connection.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Unclear Notifications</h3>
        <p>
          Users were unsure how they would know if they missed
          mentorship requests or connection invites.
        </p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p class="large-text">
      Strong UX decisions don’t just solve user problems —
      they also support business goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project helped me strengthen my ability to articulate how design
      improves engagement, retention, and long-term platform growth —
      not just usability.
