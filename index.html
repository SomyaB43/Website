                    As a recent Software Engineering graduate, I bring a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for UX design. I code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and use tools like Figma to bridge the gap between design and implementation.

            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p> My journey into tech began when I started my Software Engineering degree. I've always been curious
                    about how things work, and that natural curiosity led me to explore the world of programming and design. 
                    University was a challenge at first, I was overwhelmed at times, but I quickly discovered how 
                    rewarding it could be. The harder it got, the more I wanted to push through. That sense of <br> 
                    accomplishment is what kept me motivated.
                    <br> 
                    Throughout my studies, I found myself especially drawn to front-end development and UX design. I loved 
                    the creativity behind designing interfaces and making things not just work, but look and feel right for 
                    the user. Whether I was wire framing in Figma or styling with CSS, I realized I wanted to keep building
                    things that were both functional and beautiful.
                 <br>
                    Outside of tech, I love to read especially mystery novels and can easily lose myself in a good book. 
                    I also enjoy baking, especially whipping up sweet treats like my favorite: chocolate chip cookies.
